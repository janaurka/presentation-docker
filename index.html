# Docker
## Pros vs Cons

---

class: center, middle, .left

# Agenda

1. Motivation
1. Technique
2. What looks good?
3. Cons | Problems | Rants
4. My opinion about the use of Docker

---

# Motivation

* Containers (read NoDocker) seems to the new #1 in hipster bullshit bingo
* Containerize it! seems to be the new answer to every DevOps problem

.center[![Containerize all](pic/docker-all-the-things.png)]

---

# Technique

.center[![IBM already did that in 1960](pic/mainframe.jpg)]

---

# Nothing new

.center[![Container services](pic/old-containers.jpg)]


# What looks good?

---

# The dark side

.center[![cons](pic/docker-cons.png)]

---

# There is already a container for that

This might be a good thing, *but*:

* You loose control
* You have to trust others
  * Bad practices?
  * Security?
* You cannot control updates / changes
* Do you really want to debug this?


---

# Examples

Official PHP Container (Downloads: 163415)

Wordpress Container from Appcontainers (Downloads: 12434)

# What to do?

* Create your own lightweight containers
  * Pull from a distribution Image like Ubuntu or CentOS. *Do not* use 3rd Parties.
* Install exactly the things you need and do that properly
  * Use `apt-get`, `yum` or whatever the distribution gives you. Only compile if you know *exactly* what you are doing


---

# It’s getting complex

### Base requirements

Allows us to create, maintain and run a container:

* Linux Kernel >= 3.8 and a container-daemon (docker, rkt, etc.) or tool

Note: This is just the beginning.

---

### Further requirements

For a production (near) enviroment, we need:

* Networking
* Monitoring
* Fail-Over
* Clustering

(and this is just the absolute minimum)

---

### Using CoreOS

---

### The way Google does it

.center[![Google’s Kubernetes](pic/kubernetes.jpeg)]


---

### Possible solutions

_Use a service:_

* Google Container Service
* Amazon EC2 Container Service

Problems:

* Complete Vendor lockin
* Debugging will be a massive PITA
* These services seem to be early beta (ask Marcus, he was at the AWS Summit :) )

---

### Possible solutions

_Do it yourself:_

* CoreOS
* (various others)
* use your favorite Distro and use the services you‘d like

Problems:

* Huge effort
* These services are brand new and not-so-well battletested as we’d like to have
* Building this in the cloud = Cloud²

---

#My opinion

* Containers are cool and might (probably are) the future.
* Containerize *everything* is a bad idea.
  * Use the technology that fits best!

---

# Things you should have in mind when using containers

* Build your own Containers
  * Base: Ubuntu, CentOS, whatever. Use official (read from the OS-Manufacturer) Containers.
  * Have security in mind
  * Only use applications that support stateless-systems
  * Have a good plan to keep your data safe (also in terms of integrity, movable
